Radium is a radioactive metal, with a silvery and shiny appearance;
        it is quite soft, has a density of 5.5 g / cm 3 and a
        melting point of 696 Â° C. After protactinium, it is the rarest element on
        Earth's crust. It can be found in nature as an impurity of Uranium minerals.
   	 It was first isolated in 1893 by Marie Curie
        (Nobel Prize for chemistry and physics), together with her husband
        Pierre Curie. Radium is among the most radioactive elements in nature,
        And its samples are surrounded by a bluish luminescence.
        The harmful effects of radioactivity remained unknown for many
        years, so much so that radium was used in the most varied products
        they began to add tin to produce the bronze. It is the second most thermally and electrically
        conductive element (after silver); these properties, together with 
        its ductility and malleability, make this metal common in many
        processes (for example, since 1877 it has been used to create cables and also coveralls
        space contain copper to help those who wear them maintaining body heat)
        and in the formation of alloys (more than 400 alloys contain copper). It is resistant to
        corrosion thanks to a natural patina that forms on the surface and can be recycled
        infinite times without losing its properties. It also has antibacterial and
        antiseptic characteristics and this is why it is used in the production of coins, kitchen utensils and pipes.
