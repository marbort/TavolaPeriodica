       The chemical element Lanthanum was discovered by the Swedish chemist
        Mosander in 1839, while analyzing a cerium salt. From the salt solution
        he isolated a 'rare part' that he baptized lantana. The origin of the name comes from the
        Greek <i> lanthanein </i> whose meaning is "hide". Lanthanum is
        a light, metallic element, silvery-white, malleable and
        ductile: it is also very tender, so much that it can be cut with a knife.
        It is found in the minerals of other so-called rare earths, along with others
        lanthanides. It reacts with water giving hydrogen, is very reactive and combines
        directly with many non-metallic elements such as carbon, nitrogen, boron,
        phosphorus, sulfur and halogens. It oxidizes rapidly, both in hot and cold temperatures,
        giving compounds in which it only has oxidation number +3. As well as
        other rare earths, it is extracted from minerals such as monazite and bastnasite,
        and 12,000 tons of it are produced per year. Lanthanum is
        not very abundant on the earth's crust and therefore its extraction entails
        large amounts of waste. It is used for the production of catalysts,
        in the optical industry to produce special glasses and in the production
        of steel. If inhaled it can cause a pulmonary embolism and cancer and is
        thus becoming a health problem in many workplaces. Its
        chloride can be used as an anticoagulant by patients with 
        severe kidney insufficiency to limit the excess of phosphorus in blood.
