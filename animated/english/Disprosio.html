        Dysprosium is an element found in the periodic table in the
        group of lanthanides, otherwise called rare earths; this name was given because they were thought to be scarcely available. In reality, the
        rare earths are quite common on the earth's surface, though
        commercially exploitable deposits are located in not many places,
       (Russia, China and Australia). Dysprosium is twice
        more abundant than pond. About 100 tons are obtained every year by
        working minerals like the monazite. It has a silvery, metallic and
        shiny look, it is relatively stable in air at room temperature but can
        be slowly oxidized by oxygen. It dissolves quickly in solutions
        diluted with mineral acids and when it releases hydrogen it forms briskly
        colored salts , which are typically hydrates, such as dysprosium nitrate
        pentahydrate, Dy(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>â€¢5H<sub>2</sub> in which the metal
        is in the oxidation state +3. It is tender enough to be able to
        be cut with a knife and can be worked without issuing
        Sparks. It was discovered in 1886 by the chemist P.E. Lecoq De Boisbaudran
        (in the photo the rooster appears from the translation of the surname of the discoverer)
        which has purified it from an element quite similar to itself and to another
        lanthanide, yttrium. Among the uses of metal it is worth remembering 
        its use in the realization of dosimeters for radioactivity control,
        but also as source of infrared radiation, in the preparation
        of materials for the use of lasers and finally in the preparation of bar
        regulation for nuclear reactors.
