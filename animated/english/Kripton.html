       Krypton belongs to the eighteenth group and is found in the 4th period.
        It was discovered by examining the residual evaporation of liquid air and it was
        listed as an element in 1898. The root of its name is Greek: <i> κρυπτός </i> means hidden.
        It is a noble gas, hence the crown in the photo. Chemically, it is  almost completely inert, with the exception
        of some compounds with fluorine. In 1960 the wavelength emitted by the isotope
        Kr-86 was first used to define the meter measurement unit used until 1983. It is also used in
        photography  in some types of flash bulbs and to lengthen the life of the filaments
        of some sorts of light bulbs. We thought of recreating a winter setting
        as the concentration of krypton in the north pole is 30% higher than in the south pole. We chose to dress our character as  Superman because he comes from the planet Krypton, so called by the comic’s creator because it recalls the element's name; according to the comic book story
        The fragments of kryptonite, an imaginary mineral from the planet Krypton, are dangerous
        to  our superhero because they weaken him to death.
