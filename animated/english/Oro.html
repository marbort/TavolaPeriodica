       Gold is a soft, heavy, ductile and malleable metal, it belongs
        to the transition metals of the 6th period; it is yellow, unless
        it is in the form of nanoparticles, where it takes on completely different colors.
        It is an excellent conductor and its density is among the
        higher found in metals (1930 kg / m 3). It is a non-reactive metal,
        in fact it is found pure in the rocks in the form of nuggets. It reacts with
        mercury forming an amalgam. Its symbol Au derives from the Latin <i> aurum </i>.
        Gold is an element that man has discovered and used since ancient times
        to mint coins or to make objects but, as the saying goes, "Not all
        that glitters is gold ‚Äù, and gold has brought, together with wealth, many conflicts 
        that destroyed the populations that host the main deposits of this
        precious metal. Gold has always bewitched man with his
        glow, prompting them to undertake battles for his possession, but it
        also encouraged to always create new shapes and jewels to amaze the world with its beauty.
