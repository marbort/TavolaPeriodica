       It is element 89 of the periodic table and it lends its name to a group of radioactive elements, the so-called actinides: these are all synthetic elements except for the first four of the group;  they are all characterized by very short half lives. Actinium is a silver-colored metal and because of its radioactive intensity can emit a gloomy bluish light in the dark. Its name comes from the Greek term  <i>aktinos</i>, which means ray. Actinium was isolated in 1899 by the French chemist André-Louis Debierne, friend and colleague of Mr and Mrs Curie. He discovered the element while working on pitchblende, an uranium-based mineral from which the Curies had already isolated polonium and radium and that contains an average of 1/10th gram of actinium per ton. Actinium found in nature is composed by one single radioactive isotope Ac-227, and traces of it are found in minerals as a product from  uranium-235 decay; it also decays into thorium-227 through beta (ß) emission with a half-life of 21,773 years. In terms of health-related risks, it is to be considered almost as dangerous as plutonium. Ac-227 is used for thermo-electric generators in artificial satellites, as the emission of alpha (α) particles from decay releases an important amount of energy (radioactivity).
