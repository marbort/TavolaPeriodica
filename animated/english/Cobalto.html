       Cobalt is a transition metal, whose atomic number is 27; that’s why  the character
        which represents it shows on the collar of the shirt the atomic number 27 and has the electronic structure on the left side of the jacket. Cobalt blue is a famous pigment, synthesized
        for the first time in 1802 by Thénard by heating together cobalt phosphate and alumina;
        that's why the character is dressed in blue. Cobalt is found in living organisms,
        human beings included and is the fundamental element of vitamin B12; for this reason, the
        character has the formula of the embroidered vitamin on the jacket (under the pocket) and the
        vitamin capsules in the pocket, as well as the red tie. To the top left of the character
        the cobalt-60 isotope decay process was added to remind us of the use
        of this isotope as a source of gamma rays in radiotherapy. To the bottom right of the
        character is the image of an important cobalt mineral or heterogenite,
        meaning that cobalt is not found in nature in its pure metallic state, but only as a mineral.
