       Cerium is the first lanthanide to be discovered; it was discovered by the Swedish scientists Berzelius and Hisinger in 1803. It was Berzelius that gave the element its name, in honour of the dwarf planet Ceres that had been discovered only two years before. It is a silvery-white, ductile metal and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. Cerium is used in the lighting industry to increase luminosity and can be found in lighters due to its pyrophoric properties. Its most common compound is cerium oxide, a glazing compound known as “the jeweller’s lipstick” and used to polish gems and glass; when added to gas oil, cerium oxide increases its combustion efficiency and is used as a catalyst.
  Cerium is present in our homes in equipment such as color televisions, fluorescent lamps, energy-saving lamps and in glass.
         In the nineteenth century, cerium salts were used as antiemetics in
         cough syrups and in antibacterial treatments (the characteristic
         sweet taste was an added values to their medicinal properties). Primo Levi in
         his book "The Periodic System" says he found cylinders of cerium in the laboratory of the concentration camp and made stones out of them to be used in 
         cigarette lighters: a flint in exchange for a ration of bread! Thanks to cerium,
         Levi managed to survive until the arrival of the Russians.
