  <td><h2>Hafnium</h2></td>
  <!--========================-->
  	<text1big>It is a silver and lustrous transition metal; it is chemically similar to Zirconium and, as a matter of fact, it can be often be found in Zirconium minerals.
 
    	This ductile metal is corrosion resistant. Hafnium properties are influenced by zirconium impurities and the two elements are extremely difficult to separate. The main difference between these two lies in their density: the density of Zirconium is half that of Hafnium. The latter metal is alkali-resistant, even though it can react to halogens.
When subjected to high temperatures, Hafnium reacts with other non-metals such as oxygen, nitrogen, Carbon, Boron, Sulfur and Silicon. This element was discovered by the Hungarian chemist De Hevesy, together with his colleague Coster, in 1923. Both chemists decided to follow the hypothesis according to which the element following Zirconium in the periodic table could not be Lanthanum, as proposed by Mendeleev; they believed there was a space there for an element that could be more similar to Zirconium, so they finally isolated Hafnium from Zirconium minerals. The hypothesis that led them to this discovery started from an idea of Bohr, a Danish physician. In his honor, the element was named after the original name of Copenaghen, Hafnia. Hafnium and its compounds can be used in nuclear reactors’ control rods, as this element is able to absorb neutrons. Hafnium is also used in alloys with Tungsten in lamp filaments and electrodes and it is therefore used in the production of incandescent light bulbs. Because of its refractory characteristics, it can also be used in the production of ceramics.

Americium’s name recalls the name of the land where it was first discovered: it was indeed synthesized in 1944 in the laboratories of the University of Chicago.
    	Americium is a radioactive, white-silver metal, though it loses its sheen when in direct contact with air.
It can be found in some ionization or cell smoke detectors; it is indeed thanks to its air-ionization abilities that it was used as main component in lightning protection. The isotope Am-242 is the pilot element of Project 242, a study led by the Nobel Prize scientist Carlo Rubbia for the creation of a thermonuclear rocket. Thanks to an Americium-alimented reactor, this rocket could travel from Earth to Mars in approximately 45 days.

One of the few chemical compounds known to contain argon , argon fluorohydride, is highly unstable. Argon can be used in a chemical preparation with nitrogen in  to fill incandescent light bulbs with inert gases. Argon can also be used in the sanitary field, both in surgery to eliminate cancer cells and in argon-based scalpels for blood coagulation.

      <text1>It is element 89 of the periodic table and it lends its name to a group of radioactive elements, the so-called actinides: these are all synthetic elements except for the first four of the group;  they are all characterized by very short half lives. Actinium is a silver-colored metal and because of its radioactive intensity can emit a gloomy bluish light in the dark. Its name comes from the Greek term  <i>aktinos</i>, which means ray. Actinium was isolated in 1899 by the French chemist André-Louis Debierne, friend and colleague of Mr and Mrs Curie. He discovered the element while working on pitchblende, an uranium-based mineral from which the Curies had already isolated polonium and radium and that contains an average of 1/10th gram of actinium per ton. Actinium found in nature is composed by one single radioactive isotope Ac-227, and traces of it are found in minerals as a product from  uranium-235 decay; it also decays into thorium-227 through beta (ß) emission with a half-life of 21,773 years. In terms of health-related risks, it is to be considered almost as dangerous as plutonium. Ac-227 is used for thermo-electric generators in artificial satellites, as the emission of alpha (α) particles from decay releases an important amount of energy (radioactivity).

        its color is shiny and grey, its melting point is 1287 °C, it has  low density, it is hard but brittle. While Beryllium is an extremely good thermal and electric conductor and chemically very stable, it is also very toxic metal. It was discovered in 1789 by a French chemist, L.N. Vaquelin, that named the element “glucinium” due to its really sweet taste. Only later was it classified as a carcinogen and, if inhaled, it can cause severe lung damage, similar to pneumonia, called “Berylliosis”. This was probably the same disease that caused the death of Enrico Fermi, who used beryllium for years during his studies on artificial radioactivity with neutron emission.  The modern name was proposed and eventually chosen in 1949. One of its minerals, called berillo, is the component of two precious stones, emerald and aquamarine, depending on the presence of chrome or iron impurities.  
Beryllium is used in magnesium and aluminium alloys in order to increase their hardness, mechanical resistance and corrosion resistance.
There is another alloy created by beryllium together with copper, nickel and cobalt, called Beryllium bronze; this is highly used to create tools for the mineral industry or for the production of explosives, as this metal does not generate sparks.

Every year 14000 tons of Cadmium are produced, mostly in the New World (canada, United States, Mexico). This metal has most of the times the same state of oxidation, which is +2. It is interesting to notice that Cadmium is extracted from metallic zinc using a purification process of vacuum distillation that takes into account Cadmium volatility, which is higher than the one of zinc. The meain use of Cadmium is in batteries; even though it is less performant than other elements, it is long lasting, has low maintenance costs and an elevated resistance to physical and electric stress.  It can also be used to create oxidation resistant films to laminate steel and zinc or for the production of pigments and fertilizers. Cadmium compounds are all carcinogenic.

It is a silvery-white, ductile metal and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. Cerium is used in the lighting industry to increase luminosity and can be found in lighters due to its pyrophoric properties. Its most common compound is cerium oxide, a glazing compound known as “the jeweller’s lipstick” and used to polish gems and glass; when added to gas oil, cerium oxide increases its combustion efficiency and is used as a catalyst.
  Cerium is present in our homes in equipment such as color televisions, fluorescent lamps, energy-saving lamps and in glass.
         In the nineteenth century, cerium salts were used as antiemetics in
         cough syrups and in antibacterial treatments (the characteristic
         sweet taste was an added values to their medicinal properties). Primo Levi in

        It is the most abundant metal on earth and is also the most widely used, especially
        in alloy with carbon, with which it forms steel and cast iron. It has ferromagnetic characteristics
       , so it is able to magnetize under the action of an external magnetic field
         and then remain magnetized for a long time. Iron is essential
        for the life of all living beings, with the exception of some bacteria. it is also
        an essential part of hemoglobin: it colors red blood and carries oxygen
        throughout the body. Iron is found in many foods, such as meat, fish, eggs, but
        also in many vegetable products, in particular legumes and dried fruit. This explains
        why the boy in the picture eats a sandwich stuffed with pieces of iron! Caution

        as a strongly irritating pale yellow gas with a low boiling temperature
        (-188.2 ° C) and low density (1.7 g / cm <sup> 3 </sup>). It is a very reactive element, even with water,
        and in nature it is mainly available as a mineral, mainly fluorite combined with 
        calcium (CaF<sub>2</sub>). From this compound comes the Latin root of its name,
        fluere, which means agent that melts. We have chosen to represent a tooth because
        fluoride administered in the form of tablets or in toothpaste reduces the risk of
cavity and protects the enamel. In fact, once dissolved in the saliva, it is fixed to the surface
        of the tooth in the form of hydroxyapatite, fortifying the enamel as it can plug any
         present holes. Our tooth, in the picture, is fluorescent yellow because of the known fluorescence effect

  <!--========================-->
    <text1> Phosphorus is the 15th element of the periodic table and belongs to the
        nitrogen group. Its name comes from <i> phosphoros </i> which in Greek means "bearer of light".
        In fact, in the air, in its form called white phosphorus, it oxidizes slowly and emits
        a faint luminescence clearly visible in the dark. Because of its high reactivity,
        it is never found in nature as a free element but combined in the form of minerals,
        constituting about 0.11% of the earth's crust (it is the twelfth element in order of
        abundance). It comes in different allotropic forms, called white, red and black phosphorus.
        The white phosphorus, with a waxy consistency, is sadly famous since in contact with
        oxygen from the air it produces phosphorus pentoxide, which reacts violently with compound
        containing water such as human tissue, dehydrating them by producing phosphoric acid. For this reason
        it is still used today to build grenades used in war with devastating results on people.
        Red phosphorus is relatively stable, it is obtained by heating white phosphorus for a few hours.
        it has a variable orange to purple color, is much less reactive than the white form and is
        used in matches as a flammable material. The third allotropic form, black phosphorus,
        is obtained by heating white phosphorus at high pressures; it has a metallic appearance, similar to graphite,
        and just like graphite it has the ability to conduct electric current.

        Mosander in 1839, while analyzing a cerium salt. From the salt solution
        he isolated a 'rare part' that he baptized lantana. The origin of the name comes from the
        Greek <i> lanthanein </i> whose meaning is "hide". Lanthanum is
        a light, metallic element, silvery-white, malleable and
        ductile: it is also very tender, so much that it can be cut with a knife.
        It is found in the minerals of other so-called rare earths, along with others
        lanthanides. It reacts with water giving hydrogen, is very reactive and combines
        directly with many non-metallic elements such as carbon, nitrogen, boron,
        phosphorus, sulfur and halogens. It oxidizes rapidly, both in hot and cold temperatures,
        giving compounds in which it only has oxidation number +3. As well as
        other rare earths, it is extracted from minerals such as monazite and bastnasite,
        and 12,000 tons of it are produced per year. Lanthanum is
        not very abundant on the earth's crust and therefore its extraction entails
        large amounts of waste. It is used for the production of catalysts,
        in the optical industry to produce special glasses and in the production
        of steel. If inhaled it can cause a pulmonary embolism and cancer and is
        thus becoming a health problem in many workplaces. Its
        chloride can be used as an anticoagulant by patients with 
        severe kidney insufficiency to limit the excess of phosphorus in blood.

        Latona sent Artemis and Apollo, his only sons, to kill all the offspring
        of Niobe. This rather rare metal is taking revenge
        thanks to its properties that make it about seven times more expensive
        than copper: it is a perfect substitute for the components of the current metal alloys
         that  increases their lightness and strength, does not deform

        It is a superconductor, it can be found in lenses and mobile phones, therefore each
        of us uses some of this transitional metal! It is even used
        in jewelry: treated niobium gives lasting, permanent and iridescent colors
        like fuchsia, purple, green and turquoise. This rainbow of colors is not
        the effect of enamelling or painting, but is due to thin layers of oxide
        of niobium of different thickness that, if affected by light, produce a vast range of colors by interference.

  <!--========================-->
      <text1>It is a silvery-gray, radioactive, crystalline element, it is the first
         element ever produced by man; its name derives from the
         Greek <i> tecnetos </i> which means artificial. Technetium is a product
         of nuclear fusion waste (6%) and is the lightest radioactive element;
         it has also no stable isotopes. It is used in nuclear medicine for diagnostic purposes:
         it is considered as an "ecological" radionuclide as it emits only radiation
         energy range is not too high, but high enough to obtain images,
         and does not contaminate the environment thanks to the brevity of its half life, that only lasts
         6 hours; this means that it is self-depleted within a few days.
         One of its salt is also used as a protection against corrosion.

Tellurium (Te) has atomic number 52. It is a fragile semi-metal of
        white-silver color, chemically similar to selenium and sulfur.
        It is used mainly in alloys and as a semiconductor. Rare element in nature,
        it is easily pulverized, its electronic conductivity increases
        sensibly when exposed to light, it is flammable in the air, it burns
        with a blue-greenish flame. In its molten state it is able to corrode copper,
        iron and stainless steel. Humans exposed to concentrations of
        tellurium in the air of only 0.01 mg / m <sup> 3 </sup> develop the so-called "tellurium breath",
        which vaguely recalls the smell of garlic; the symptoms are headache, nausea,
        drowsiness, eye and respiratory tract irritation. Tellurium
        should be handled with care and is considered toxic. It is used above all
        in alloy with other metals, it is a component of ceramics and glass,
        it is added as an additive in petrol, it is found in photovoltaic panels
        where it has the best yields by converting light into electricity,
        although for now this application of tellurium has not yet had a strong
        impact on the market. We represented this element with a solar panel,
       and highlighting toxicity to humans.

         nature can be found in solid state. It was discovered in 1843 by Carl Gustav Mosander,
         it is a relatively rare and practically useless element. Our photo is
         divided into two parts: the first part illustrates the use of terbium in the past,
         more precisely in the 90s, when it was commonly used for
         the cathode ray tubes of televisions. In the other part it is illustrated 
         the use of this metal today: terbium has fallen into disuse and is
         currently not used for any purpose, it is therefore unused in every sector.

Thorium is the chemical element with atomic number 90. It is a metal
        actinide and is one of the only two significant radioactive elements to be found
        in nature in large quantities (the other is uranium).
        Furthermore, all its known isotopes are unstable. Thorium has been discovered
        in 1828 by the Swedish chemist Jons Jacob Berzelius. You are always exposed to
        small amounts of thorium through air, food and water. Breathing
        thorium in the workplace (mines and factories) increases the odds
        of pancreatic and lung tumors. It is mainly used in the net
        for portable gas lights, for scientific instrumentation in optics and
        as fuel in nuclear power plants. Our idea for the photo comes
        from the origin of the name of the element (Thor, Norse god); we have in fact decided
        to dress the model as the god of thunder, but with the peculiarity of showing
        the electronic configuration of the element on the chest.

         and malleable. It is a fairly stable metal in the air, but very sensitive to
         humidity, is flammable and can react explosively. It is a very rare element
         and its market price is around 70000 $ / kg. Its
         reserves are estimated around 100,000 tons, and can be found in China, United States,
         Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, for a worldwide production of around 50 tons per year. Thulium (in particular its isotope 170)
         is used for the construction of equipment for X-rays and
         laser and can be used in magnetic ceramic material and 
         in microwave devices. It is not considered a toxic element.

         looks like a silver colored metal. It is used for incandescent filaments
         in lamps and scientific equipment
         (UV / Vis spectrophotometers) as it is the metal with the highest point of
         fusion. Its alloys with iron are hard and resistant, and are used
         to manufacture mechanical tools and materials for the aerospace industry.
         Some of its compounds are used as catalysts in chemical reactions.
         Tungsten carbide is used as a material for dental burs.

      <text1>Xenon is a noble gas (Z = 54) that was discovered in 1898 by the English chemists
          Sir William Ramsay and Morris William. Being a rare gas
         (0.000001% in the universe), its price per liter varies between 8 and 13 euros
         (from 11 to 15 dollars), or costs from 8000 to 13000 euros per cubic meter.
         The density of xenon is equal to 5.894 Kg / m <sup> 3 </sup> while that of the air is
         equal to 1.2 Kg / m <sup> 3 </sup> (in the picture it is shown that Xenon weighs more than air). At its solid state
        (at a temperature of -111.75 ° C or 161.4 K) it has a cubic structure
         (a crystal is made up of 14 atoms as shown
         in the picture). Xenon is mainly used for white-blue light lamps
         (see photo), x-rays and, in the automotive industry, in car headlights and
