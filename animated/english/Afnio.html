      This ductile metal is corrosion resistant. Hafnium properties are influenced by zirconium impurities and the two elements are extremely difficult to separate. The main difference between these two lies in their density: the density of Zirconium is half that of Hafnium. The latter metal is alkali-resistant, even though it can react to halogens.
When subjected to high temperatures, Hafnium reacts with other non-metals such as oxygen, nitrogen, Carbon, Boron, Sulfur and Silicon. This element was discovered by the Hungarian chemist De Hevesy, together with his colleague Coster, in 1923. Both chemists decided to follow the hypothesis according to which the element following Zirconium in the periodic table could not be Lanthanum, as proposed by Mendeleev; they believed there was a space there for an element that could be more similar to Zirconium, so they finally isolated Hafnium from Zirconium minerals. The hypothesis that led them to this discovery started from an idea of Bohr, a Danish physician. In his honor, the element was named after the original name of Copenaghen, Hafnia. Hafnium and its compounds can be used in nuclear reactorsâ€™ control rods, as this element is able to absorb neutrons. Hafnium is also used in alloys with Tungsten in lamp filaments and electrodes and it is therefore used in the production of incandescent light bulbs. Because of its refractory characteristics, it can also be used in the production of ceramics.
