  <!========================>
       this element is a metal that is present only on 6/1000000 of the earth crust as an isolated isotope. <sup>9</sup>Be,
        its color is shiny and grey, its melting point is 1287 °C, it has  low density, it is hard but brittle. While Beryllium is an extremely good thermal and electric conductor and chemically very stable, it is also very toxic metal. It was discovered in 1789 by a French chemist, L.N. Vaquelin, that named the element “glucinium” due to its really sweet taste. Only later was it classified as a carcinogen and, if inhaled, it can cause severe lung damage, similar to pneumonia, called “Berylliosis”. This was probably the same disease that caused the death of Enrico Fermi, who used beryllium for years during his studies on artificial radioactivity with neutron emission.  The modern name was proposed and eventually chosen in 1949. One of its minerals, called berillo, is the component of two precious stones, emerald and aquamarine, depending on the presence of chrome or iron impurities.  
Beryllium is used in magnesium and aluminium alloys in order to increase their hardness, mechanical resistance and corrosion resistance.
There is another alloy created by beryllium together with copper, nickel and cobalt, called Beryllium bronze; this is highly used to create tools for the mineral industry or for the production of explosives, as this metal does not generate sparks.
