       Cadmium is a brilliant, ductile, malleable and white-silvered metal. In chemically inert conditions its surface has a blue-ish color, that gets blurred with air.   It was discovered in 1817 by the chemist Strohmeyer while analyzing a zinc compound, as the two are really similar; as a matter of fact, it is extracted from zinc minerals, where it can be found as an impurity. Every year 14000 tons of Cadmium are produced, mostly in the New World (canada, United States, Mexico). This metal has most of the times the same state of oxidation, which is +2. It is interesting to notice that Cadmium is extracted from metallic zinc using a purification process of vacuum distillation that takes into account Cadmium volatility, which is higher than the one of zinc. The meain use of Cadmium is in batteries; even though it is less performant than other elements, it is long lasting, has low maintenance costs and an elevated resistance to physical and electric stress.  It can also be used to create oxidation resistant films to laminate steel and zinc or for the production of pigments and fertilizers. Cadmium compounds are all carcinogenic.
