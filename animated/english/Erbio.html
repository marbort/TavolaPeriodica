       Erbium is a rare earth element with a silvery color and with
         atomic number 68. It is a soft, malleable metal and its salts are
     pink. It is used for filters in photography due to its excellent resilience,
         as an additive in metallurgy and as an absorber
         of neutrons in nuclear technology . Erbium oxide is also used as a dye for glossy polish
         used on glass or ceramic. Erbium glass is used to build sunglasses lenses. It was discovered by Carl Gustav Mosander in 1843, who separated
         the gadolinite ittria in three distinct fractions, called ittria, erbia and terbia.
         After 1860 what was known as terbia was renamed erbia and in 1877 what was first known as erbia was renamed terbia. The photo taken comes from the
         word-play between erbium and grass (in Italian “erba”), so we decided to blow on it.
