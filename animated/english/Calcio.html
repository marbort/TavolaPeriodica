        Calcium (Ca) is an alkaline-earth metal belonging to the second group and to the fourth period. It is a white-silver, ductile and malleable metal, even at lower temperatures. Known since the ancient times, but only within its compounds, it was first isolated in 1808 and gets its name from the latin term <i>calx</i> , that means “obtained by heating lime”. It is a pivotal element to living organisms in carbonate salts and in phosphates; it is also one of the main constituents of bones and teeth in the human body and its ions play an important role in human biochemistry. 
Its most famous compound is calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), which is present in many different forms both in minerals and in living organisms.
Because of its reactivity it is often used in small quantities as a compound in steel alloys.
In the picture we represented this element by showing all its different forms that can be found in nature: in shells, in the human body, in rocks (for instance, marble or dolomite), in the daily life as chalk (used both in the health industry and school supply), in food ( as dairy products and almonds) or in lime in our houses.
