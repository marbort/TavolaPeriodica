Tellurium (Te) has atomic number 52. It is a fragile semi-metal of
        white-silver color, chemically similar to selenium and sulfur.
        It is used mainly in alloys and as a semiconductor. Rare element in nature,
        it is easily pulverized, its electronic conductivity increases
        sensibly when exposed to light, it is flammable in the air, it burns
        with a blue-greenish flame. In its molten state it is able to corrode copper,
        iron and stainless steel. Humans exposed to concentrations of
        tellurium in the air of only 0.01 mg / m <sup> 3 </sup> develop the so-called "tellurium breath",
        which vaguely recalls the smell of garlic; the symptoms are headache, nausea,
        drowsiness, eye and respiratory tract irritation. Tellurium
        should be handled with care and is considered toxic. It is used above all
        in alloy with other metals, it is a component of ceramics and glass,
        it is added as an additive in petrol, it is found in photovoltaic panels
        where it has the best yields by converting light into electricity,
        although for now this application of tellurium has not yet had a strong
        impact on the market. We represented this element with a solar panel,
       and highlighting toxicity to humans.
