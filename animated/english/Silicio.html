Silicon was discovered in 1823 by the Swedish chemist Berzelius who
        obtained it from fluoride. It is one of the most abundant elements both
        on earth and in the universe. On earth it is the second most abundant element after
        oxygen and represents about 30% of the earth's crust mass, where it is found
        in the form of silicates, like quartz, and also in many eruptive sedimentary rocks
        and metamorphic rocks. It has the same crystalline shape as a diamond and it is bound in a
        tetrahedral lattice with four other identical atoms. Pure silicon is hard, but unlike
        diamond is fragile. It appears as a solid of grayish blue color e
        metallic shine, but is not a real metal. It is a semi-metal and, unlike metals,
        does not react with acids (except hydrofluoric acid); it combines with metals forming
        silicides. It reacts with high temperature halogens and alkaline hydroxides. In the world of
        and as early as 3500 BC to form the bronze alloy mixed with the copper (which
        increases hardness and mechanical qualities). It is resistant to seawater and distilled water corrosion
        , and in the presence of moisture it forms a thin layer of oxide which
        protects against further oxidation, for this reason it was used in tin sheets, paper
        foil, food and medicinal packaging; it is also used to coat
        metals such as iron, lead, zinc and alloy steel to prevent corrosion
        and produce tin for cans and cans to store food. Along with lead
        it was used to form the pewter alloy to create artistic objects, jewelry, trophies, trays, plates.
