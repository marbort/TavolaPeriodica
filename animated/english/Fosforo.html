      Phosphorus is the 15th element of the periodic table and belongs to the
        nitrogen group. Its name comes from <i> phosphoros </i> which in Greek means "bearer of light".
        In fact, in the air, in its form called white phosphorus, it oxidizes slowly and emits
        a faint luminescence clearly visible in the dark. Because of its high reactivity,
        it is never found in nature as a free element but combined in the form of minerals,
        constituting about 0.11% of the earth's crust (it is the twelfth element in order of
        abundance). It comes in different allotropic forms, called white, red and black phosphorus.
        The white phosphorus, with a waxy consistency, is sadly famous since in contact with
        oxygen from the air it produces phosphorus pentoxide, which reacts violently with compound
        containing water such as human tissue, dehydrating them by producing phosphoric acid. For this reason
        it is still used today to build grenades used in war with devastating results on people.
        Red phosphorus is relatively stable, it is obtained by heating white phosphorus for a few hours.
        it has a variable orange to purple color, is much less reactive than the white form and is
        used in matches as a flammable material. The third allotropic form, black phosphorus,
        is obtained by heating white phosphorus at high pressures; it has a metallic appearance, similar to graphite,
        and just like graphite it has the ability to conduct electric current.
